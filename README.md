# Infinite-Horizon Optimal Control of Switched Boolean Control Networks with Average Cost:  An Efficient Graph-Theoretical Approach
This repository contains the code for the paper: Shuhua Gao, Changkai Sun, Cheng Xiang, Kairong Qin, and Tong Heng Lee. *Infinite-Horizon Optimal Control of Switched Boolean Control Networks with Average Cost: An Efficient Graph-Theoretical Approach.* (To be published)



**Organization**

The core algorithm implementation is in the folder *src/algorithm*. Networks of two examples are given in the *src/network* folder.  We use three examples to show how to use this algorithm in the *src* folder, which include Example 1 and the benchmark network in the paper.

**Requirement**

Python 3.6 or higher.

**How to run**

+ Download or clone this repository to your local computer.

+ In the command line  (such as *cmd* on Windows or *terminal* on Ubuntu), go into the *src* folder

+ To run the first example, just type `python example_1.py`. (Of course, you can also use certain IDEs like PyCharm.)
